# Contributing

The best way to contribute to the development of this plugin is by participating on the GitHub project:

https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-saml-auth

Pull requests and issues are welcome!

## Workflow

The `develop` branch is the development branch which means it contains the next version to be released. `master` contains the corresponding stable development version. Always work on the `develop` branch and open up PRs against `develop`.

## Testing

You may notice there are two sets of tests running, on two different services:

* Travis CI runs the [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) test suite, which mocks interactions with SimpleSAMLphp.
* Circle CI runs the [Behat](http://behat.org/) test suite against a Pantheon site, to ensure the plugin's compatibility with the Pantheon platform. This includes configuring a fully-functional instance of SimpleSAMLphp.

Both of these test suites can be run locally, with a varying amount of setup.

PHPUnit requires the [WordPress PHPUnit test suite](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/), and access to a database with name `wordpress_test`. If you haven't already configured the test suite locally, you can run `bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost`.

Behat requires a Pantheon site. Once you've created the site, you'll need [install Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus#installation), and set the `TERMINUS_TOKEN`, `TERMINUS_SITE`, and `TERMINUS_ENV` environment variables. Then, you can run `./bin/behat-prepare.sh` to prepare the site for the test suite.

## Release Process

1. Starting from `develop`, cut a release branch named `release_X.Y.Z` containing your changes.
1. Update plugin version in `package.json`, `README.md`, `readme.txt`, and `wp-saml-auth.php`.
1. Update the Changelog with the latest changes.
1. Create a PR against the `master` branch.
1. After all tests pass and you have received approval from a CODEOWNER (including resolving any merge conflicts), merge the PR into `master`.
1. [Check the _Build and Tag_ action](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-saml-auth/actions/workflows/build-tag.yml): a new tag named with the version number should've been created. It should contain all the built assets.
1. Create a [new release](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-saml-auth/releases/new), naming the release with the new version number, and targeting the tag created in the previous step. Paste the release changelog from the `Changelog` section of the `README` into the body of the release and include a link to the closed issues if applicable.
1. Wait for the [_Release wp-saml-auth plugin to wp.org_ action](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wp-saml-auth/actions/workflows/wordpress-plugin-deploy.yml) to finish deploying to the WordPress.org repository. If all goes well, users with SVN commit access for that plugin will receive an emailed diff of changes.
1. Check WordPress.org: Ensure that the changes are live on https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-saml-auth/. This may take a few minutes.
